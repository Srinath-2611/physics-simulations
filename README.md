# 🪐 Physics Simulations in Python

A personal collection of physics simulations written in Python — exploring classical mechanics, relativity, and astrophysical phenomena.  
This project is part of my ongoing journey to understand physics through visualization, coding, and curiosity.

## 📁 Simulations

Each simulation is placed in its own folder and includes:

- 📓 A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)
- 📊 Visual output (images, animations, or plots)
- 🧠 A `README.md` with a short explanation
- ⚙️ Python-based code using NumPy & Matplotlib

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`2d_orbit_simulation/`](./2d_orbit_simulation/) | Static 2D orbit of a planet around the sun using Newtonian gravity |
| [`Animated_2D_Orbit_with_Trail/`](./Animated_2D_Orbit_with_Trail/) | Animated simulation of a planet orbiting with a visual trail |
| [`Gravitational_Light_Bending/`](./Gravitational_Light_Bending/) | Simulation of light rays bending due to gravity near a black hole |

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Malladi Aditya Naga Srinadh, an MSc Physics graduate deeply interested in **relativity**, **astrophysics**, and **computational physics**.  
This repository is a place for me to learn by doing — through code, thought experiments, and visual simulations.
