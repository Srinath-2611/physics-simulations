# 🌌 Srinath's Physics Simulations & Projects

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! I'm Srinath, an MSc Physics student deeply curious about the universe. This space is dedicated to the simulations I’ve built while exploring classical mechanics, relativity, cosmology, and spacetime through code. Every project here is designed to be insightful, visually intuitive, and beginner-friendly.

## 🔭 What You'll Find Here

A growing collection of hand-crafted physics simulations powered by Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib — visualizing concepts ranging from planetary motion to cosmic expansion.

- 🔬 Simulations grounded in real physics  
- 🎨 Clean and clear visualizations  
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebooks, runnable on Google Colab  
- 📈 Interactive or animated where possible

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srinath-2611/physics-simulations.git
   cd physics-simulations
   ```

2. Open any folder and launch the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) using:
   - Jupyter Notebook on your system
   - **Google Colab** (recommended for animation support)

3. Run cells and experiment with parameters like mass, velocity, eccentricity, or cosmological constants.
