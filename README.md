# 🪐 Physics Simulations in Python

A personal collection of physics simulations written in Python — exploring classical mechanics, relativity, and astrophysical phenomena.  
This project is part of my ongoing journey to understand physics through visualization, coding, and curiosity.

## 📁 Simulations

Each simulation is placed in its own folder and includes:

- 📓 A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`)
- 📊 Visual output (images, animations, or plots)
- 🧠 A `README.md` with a short explanation
- ⚙️ Python-based code using NumPy & Matplotlib

| Simulation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [`planetary_orbit/`](./planetary_orbit/) | 2D orbit of a planet around a star using Newtonian gravity |
| [`light_bending/`](./light_bending/) | Gravitational light bending near a massive object |
| [`static_orbit/`](./static_orbit/) | Static orbit visualization (simple circular motion) |
| _More coming soon..._ | (Elliptical orbits, gravitational waves, etc.) |
