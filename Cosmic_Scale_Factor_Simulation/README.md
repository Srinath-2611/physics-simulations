# Cosmic Scale Factor Simulation

This simulation models the evolution of the **cosmic scale factor a(t)** over time based on the standard Î›CDM model. It helps visualize how the universe expands from the Big Bang to the present epoch, showing key phases like radiation domination, matter domination, and dark energy domination.

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

![Cosmic Scale Factor](Cosmic_Scale_Factor_Simulation.png)

- The graph shows **a(t)** (normalized to 1 today) vs **time in Gyr** (billion years).
- The curve peaks as the universe transitions from a slowing expansion to an accelerating phase due to dark energy.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
- Friedmann Equation (qualitative)
- Radiation, Matter, and Dark Energy density contributions
- Cosmic time and scale factor normalization
- Expansion history from early universe to present day

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“„ Files
- `Cosmic_Scale_Factor_Simulation.ipynb` â€” Main simulation notebook
- `Cosmic_Scale_Factor_Simulation.png` â€” Output graph
