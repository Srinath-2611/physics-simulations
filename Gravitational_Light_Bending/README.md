# Gravitational Light Bending Simulation

This project simulates the bending of light rays near a supermassive black hole using Newtonian gravity-based approximations. It demonstrates how stronger gravitational fields can curve the path of light, creating a lensing-like effect.

## 🧠 Concept

In general relativity, gravity curves spacetime. This simulation approximates that behavior by numerically integrating how photons (moving at constant speed) get deflected near a massive object. It’s a simplified visual representation of gravitational lensing.
