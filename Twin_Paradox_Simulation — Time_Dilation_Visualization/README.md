# Twin Paradox Simulation — Time Dilation Visualization

This project simulates and visualizes the famous **twin paradox** from Einstein's theory of special relativity. It compares how time passes for two twins — one remaining on Earth and the other traveling at relativistic speeds — and highlights the effects of **time dilation**.

## 🧠 Concept
In the twin paradox, one twin makes a journey into space at near-light speed and returns, while the other remains on Earth. Upon return, the traveling twin has aged less than the one who stayed, due to the effects of time dilation.

This simulation plots:
- **Earth frame time** vs. **experienced time** for both the Earth-bound twin and the traveling twin.
- The time discrepancy due to relativistic travel.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Output
The graph shows how the traveling twin’s time grows slower than Earth time, depending on velocity (β).

## ✏️ Parameters You Can Experiment With
- **β (beta)**: the speed of the traveling twin as a fraction of the speed of light (e.g., 0.5, 0.9, 0.99).
- **Total Earth Time**: the total time (in years) during which the traveling twin is away.
  
Modify the `beta` and `t_max` variables in the code to see how different speeds affect the time gap!

## 📚 Future Additions
- Interactive slider for changing speed (using ipywidgets or interactive plots)
- Adding acceleration and deceleration phases
- 3D Minkowski diagram visualization

## 🧪 Educational Value
This is a great entry-level simulation to understand the real physical consequences of time dilation and frame-dependent time in special relativity.
